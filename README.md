### Hi there, my name is Rojina Deuja. I am an International student pursuing Computer Science at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Data analysis is my strong suit but I want to make myself equally competent in Full-Stack Software Development.

### You can find some of my projects here. Recently, I have worked with a lot of JavaScript (ReactJS, Node.js) and Python (Machine Learning). I also have worked on numerous projects on Java and C#(.NET) including but not limited to web applications, desktop applications, andriod and windows mobile development.
