## Hi there! 

### I am an International student pursuing Computer Science at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Data analysis is my strong suit but I am working on making myself equally competent in Full-Stack Software Development.

You can find some of my projects here. Recently, I have worked with a lot of JavaScript (ReactJS, Node.js) and Python (Machine Learning). 

I've also worked on numerous projects on Java and C#(.NET) including but not limited to Web applications, Desktop applications, Andriod and Windows app development.
