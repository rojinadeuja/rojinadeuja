**I invest most of my time learning Data Science. I am really interested in building innovative Data-driven solutions that can refine traditional software paradigms.**

You can find some of my projects here. Right now, I'm mostly working with **JavaScript (ReactJS, Node.js) and Python (for Machine Learning)**.

I also have experiences with **Java and C#(.NET)** for Web applications, desktop applications, android and windows mobile app development.
